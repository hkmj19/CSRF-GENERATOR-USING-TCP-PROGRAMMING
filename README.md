CSRF POC Generator using TCP Server-Client with the VBA Interface.
Developed a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Proof-of-Concept (PoC) Generator using a TCP Server-Client
model. The client, built with VBA (Visual Basic for Applications), provides an interactive UI for users to input
request parameters (HTTP Method, Encoding, Data, and URI). The Python-based TCP server dynamically
generates CSRF attack payloads and sends them back to the client as an HTML file.
